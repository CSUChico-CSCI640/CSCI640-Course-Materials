# CSCI640 Syllabus

## Prerequisite

CSCI-311, or CSCI 605 and CSCI211; and classified graduate standing.

Classified graduate standing.

Students who take this class without completing the prerequisite class will be given a failing grade.


## Course Accounts

You need an account in the CSCI assignment turn-in system. See Canvas instructions for signing in and registering for [https://inginious.csuchico.edu](https://inginious.csuchico.edu).

Enroll in CSCI 640, make sure you enroll in the correct section.

You will use this system to turn in some of your programming and lab assignments.

## Textbook

If you like books and usually use your textbooks, then buy this book as it's a good reference. If you never open textbooks, then don't buy it but one of the assignments is derived from this book of materials so may be helpful.

*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 3rd edition*
by Randal E. Bryant, David R. O'Hallaron
(2015) Pearson Pub Co: ISBN-10: 013409266X

Or alternatively the older edition.

*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 2nd edition*
by Randal E. Bryant, David R. O'Hallaron
(2010) Addison-Wesley Pub Co: ISBN-10: 0136108040

The book is optional as the majority of the course will focus on research and research papers; however, for the individual projects this book will be extremely helpful. The book also focuses on C and this course will not be C focused.

## Attendance

Attendance of all lectures is not required, but it can help your grade and is highly recommended.

Attendance may improve your grade. For example, if your grade is a high B+ and you have attended most/all the lectures I may raise your grade to a A-.

Missing class can make the projects and exams especially difficult. If I verbally change the requirements of a project during lecture, you are responsible for meeting the new requirements. If you miss a class make sure you get notes from another student.

If you regularly skip class I will not answer questions on the material you missed.

## Grading

Grades for this course will be relative. The students that do the best work will get an A, the students that don't do as well get a B, and so on. I will likely not be following at traditional percentage grades of 90% for an A, 80% for a B, etc., and I don't like to grade on a curve as if I applied blindly could result in grades actually being lowered if everyone is doing very well in the course.

I will routinely post the grading to Canvas. If you are not happy with a grade, talk to me immediately. If you do not talk to me within a week of the posting of a grade, I will assume you think the grade is fair and accurate, and you will lose your right to dispute the grade.

### Grade Category Percentages:

* Individual Projects 50% of course grade
* Required Readings 10% of course grade
* Paper Presentation 5% of course grade (If these don't happen will be folded into project grade)
* Group Project 35% of course grade
* Lecture Participation (+/- 5% of course grade) a large aspect of this course's lectures will be group discussions about the research papers assigned, recommended, etc. related to current or seminal OS research. These may be submitted by me or fellow students as such I want to encourage you to participate. Failing to participate will result in a detriment to your grade and going above/beyond participation can lead to extra credit on your overall grade.
* Lecture Attendance can improve/lower your grade (see above)

### Project Grading Meetings

I will be testing your project submissions for code plagiarism and any of you who fail these tests will be required to meet with me for detailed interviews about the assignments. If is apparent you didn't do any of the work I reserve the right to treat your submission as a violation of the Honesty Policy.

### Project Grading Quiz

For any non-inquiry based assignment 30% of the assignment grade will come from an in class quiz where you will need to answer questions about how aspects of your code works. This won't rule you out from further one-on-one grading meetings if I am concerned that you actually did your work.



## Programming Assignments

There will 3 assignments that will be done individually.

### Late Assignments:

* Assignments turned in 1-24 hours after the due date will lose 15%
* Assignments will NOT be accepted more that 24 hours after the due date.

## Getting Help/E-mail

As this is a upper division course you'll likely want to make use of my office hours for help as it is unlikely there are tutors or other such resources.

We will be using Piazza for a class discussion board. You'll be invited via email; however there a link to the discussion board on Canvas well. General questions about the course, clarifications for an assignment, etc should be asked here so that other students in the course can benefit and I don't need to answer the same question multiple times. If you email me a question that should have been posted to the discussion board I'll ask you to ask it on the discussion board before I'll answer it.

Additionally, you can email me directly with any specific questions, the distinction would be help with your code or assignment that would be unique to you and sharing with the class on the discussion board would be considered cheating. Make sure you put 'CSCI640' in the subject so it will be filtered correctly. ALL EMAIL WITH NO SUBJECT WILL NOT BE OPENED, so if you send me an email without a subject do not expect a response as I will not open it or respond to it.

I'll be making it a habit to respond immediately to emails received between 9am-5pm, except when I'll otherwise be in a meeting, lecture, etc. Any emails outside of those times will be answered as I can or potentially the next morning at 9am, so try to make sure to email me prior to 5pm.

I will routinely communicate with the class via announcements on the Piazza board. Make sure the email you use on Piazza is one you routinely check in case there is an important announcement.

If you do not sign up for the Piazza account, you will not receive the class e-mails and may miss important information about the class.

If you drop the class, you should be able to un-enroll from the Piazza discussion board to stop receiving messages. Let me know if you drop the class and still get e-mail.

## Responsibilities

Taken from Professor Tyson Henry's 211 syllabus as it's a good statement concerning responsibilities for any given course:

I am responsible for providing useful and interesting (and I hope entertaining) lectures, meaningful and challenging assignments, challenging exams, abundant help, encouragement, advice, and most anything else I can do to help you learn the material.

Students are responsible for dedicating the time and effort necessary to learn the material. The amounts of time and effort required varies drastically. It may take you two hours/week to get an A in this class. It may take you 20 hours/week to get a C. It is your responsibility to figure out how much time you require and to invest that amount of time appropriate for you.

You will not learn the material if you don't put in the time and effort required. If you don't learn the material you will not be prepared for the subsequent classes and you will probably be very disappointed with your grade. While I will feel bad that I had to assign you a bad grade, if you don't put in the time necessary for success I will be forced to give you a low grade. The University requires that I assign grades based on your performance.

## Honesty

The first time you cheat, you will get a 0 on the test or assignment. The second time you cheat you will fail the class. It is not a good idea to cheat in my class. I will be following Tyson Henry's Cheating Policy:



> I expect all students to understand and follow the University?s honesty policies (http://www.csuchico.edu/prs/EMs/2004/04-036.shtml). I will fail students who do not follow these policies, even if they don't understand them. It is your responsibility to understand these policies.

> The bottom line is that you must do all the assignments on your own. Turning in code that anyone else wrote is cheating and will result in failing the course. Here are some examples of cheating:

> * copying code from another student
> * copying code from a book
> * copying code from the Internet
> * getting your friends to write your code
> * paying someone else to write your code
> * pestering other students until they give you their code
> * buying code
> * stealing code
> * letting someone steal your code (e.g. giving out your password, or using incorrect file protection)
> * giving your code to another student (both giving code and taking code are forms of cheating)
> * giving your laptop that contains your program to another student
> * getting so much help on an assignment that you are no longer doing the assignment (this can come from one helper or many helpers)
> * crowdsourcing your code
> * ChatGPT or use of other LLMs
> * the list can go on...


> On the other hand, you are allowed to discuss projects and you may get help each other find bugs. Just make sure you don't get so much help that you are no longer doing the work.

> Required Consultation: If I suspect that you did not do your own work (e.g. someone else wrote your programs), you are required to meet with me and discuss your program. During this meeting I will ask you simple questions about your program. If you don't know how your program works I will assume you have cheated. In the event that you refuse to meet with me I will:

> * assume you cheated
> * give you a zero
> * report you to Student Judicial Affairs.



> I reserve the right to catch cheaters after the end of the semester. Just because a cheater makes it to the end of the semester without being caught does not mean he or she has gotten away with it. Since I keep assignments it is possible for me to catch cheaters after the fact. For example, assume your friend George gives you his old program and you turn it in. Next semester George might give his program to someone else and I could catch it. Now I will look through all old programs to see who else George has given his program to. One of my advantages is that I can use programs to look for all instances of an assignment over the past several years. And while I might not catch everyone, I am always amazed at the people I do catch.

## Religious Holidays

I will work with students so this class and its assignments, exams, and activities do not interfere with religious holidays. However, you must notify me ahead of time so we can make appropriate arrangements.

## Americans with Disabilities Act

If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability or chronic illness, or if you need to make special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible, or see me during office hours. Please also contact Accessibility Resource Center (ARC) as they are the designated department responsible for approving and coordinating reasonable accommodations and services for students with disabilities. ARC will help you understand your rights and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and provide you further assistance with requesting and arranging accommodations.

## Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus.  I may also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030).  Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related resources are available here: [www.csuchico.edu/title-ix](http://www.csuchico.edu/title-ix)


## Safe Zone Statement

I am part of the Safe Zone Ally community network of trained Chico State faculty/staff/students who are available to listen and support you in a safe and confidential manner. As a Safe Zone Ally, I can help you connect with resources on campus to address problems you may face that interfere with your academic and social success on campus as it relates to issues surrounding sexual orientation/gender identity. My goal is to help you be successful and to maintain a safe and equitable campus.

## LGBTQ Equality Statement

I am firmly committed to diversity and equality in all areas of campus life, including specifically members of the LGBTQ community. In this class I will work to promote an anti-discriminatory environment where everyone feels safe and welcome. I recognize that discrimination can be direct or indirect and take place at both institutional and personal levels. I believe that such discrimination is unacceptable and I am committed to providing equality of opportunity for all by eliminating any and all discrimination, harassment, bullying, or victimization. The success of this policy relies on the support and understanding of everyone in this class. We all have a responsibility not to be offensive to each other, or to participate in, or condone harassment or discrimination of any kind.
